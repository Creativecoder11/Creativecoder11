Are you looking for developers with resourceful UI knowledge? If yes, then, I can easily convert UX/UI files into pixel-perfect and fast-loading front-end and make it responsive across all platforms. I have deep knowledge and passion towards JavaScript/TypeScript and its frameworks. I have extensive experience in both the simplest and the most complex web and mobile applications. In these projects, features were developed such as customized components, forms creation, and dynamic lists in a CRM, as well as an automatic application generator or rich interfaces with options to drag and drop elements, complex components with perfect design with perfect pixel details, and complete applications being created and handled directly based on the user's permission.

Skills: VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
